Strange is this new faction.

To unlock, you visit Lycia, Midnight, or Amador.

Once the missions complete, your faction store is unlocked and you can claim
the free 6 bp per 22h in addition to the 36 you got from the missions.

A few days later (if you don't buy the rest) you can have the build parts to
build.

Look for a free 1M tritanium card in the free chest area.

Once built, you complete the 'build the Botnay Bay' mission that then
unlocks the path into augment space.  Further missions will unlock further
paths, but once your path is unlocked, any ship can set course that has
a high enough warp level.

Look at the faction store for cards to unlock officers by purchasing chests
with augment faction credits.

When entering augment space, the `mines' are clustered in groups of 3 with
a 3d object pointing to where they are. The actual mine location is invisible.

The data you mine can be used to purchase credits from the faction store which
in turn can be used to purchase things from the augment faction store.

lvl18 shipyard required to build the Botany Bay surveyor ship.

lvl20 required to see plutonium in the augment faction store.

lvl24 + pawn reputation required to see uncommon plutonium in the faction store.

lvl30 required to see rare plutonium in the faction store.
