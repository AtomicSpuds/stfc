Augment (:aug:) has some saying it is a waste of time. I submit that the
following benifits are not a waste of time:

 - Khan's crew (only place in the game to unlock and get shards for them) helps bust bases
 - rewards during data mining events
 - 10k-50k oxp per day once Khan's crew has max shards (note: leveling up not required)

Generally speaking, once you have unlocked Augment Faction Space, the following is a brief synopsis:

   { decoded data , corrupt data } -> { augment rep, augment credit }

   { augment credit } -> { plutonium (common, uncommon, rare), independent credits, recruit tokens }

To get started and unlock Augment space, you must go through some missions.
Visit Lycia, Midnight, or Amador.

To enter Augment space you must build the Botnay Bay (BB).

The missions provide 36 bp, and then your Augment Faction Store is unlocked.
Until you get enough bp to build one BB, you can claim 6 bp free per 22h.

Alternately, there has been a purchase option for the BB for the impatient.

Look for a free 1M tritanium card in the free chest area to help you build
your BB, it requires 800k tritanium.

Once built, you complete the `build the Botnay Bay` mission that then unlocks the path into Augment space.  Further missions will unlock further paths, but once your path is unlocked, any ship can set course that has a high enough warp level.

Look at the Augment Faction Store for cards to unlock officers by purchasing chests with Augment faction credits.

When entering Augment space, the `mines' are clustered in groups of 3 with a 3d object pointing to where they are. The actual mine location is invisible.

The data you mine can be used to purchase credits from the faction store which
in turn can be used to purchase things from the Augment faction store.

lvl18 shipyard required to build the Botany Bay surveyor ship.

lvl20 required to see plutonium in the Augment faction store.

lvl24 + pawn reputation required to see uncommon plutonium in the faction store.

lvl30 required to see rare plutonium in the faction store.
