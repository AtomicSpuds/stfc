Strange is this new faction.

To unlock, you visit Lycia, Midnight, or Amador.

Once the missions complete, your faction store is unlocked and you can claim
the free 6 bp per 22h in addition to the 36 you got from the missions.

A few days later (if you don't buy the rest) you can have the build parts to
build.

Look for a free 1M tritanium card in the free chest area.

Look at the faction store for cards to unlock officers by purchasing chests
with augment faction credits.

The data you mine can be used to purchase credits from the faction store which
in turn can be used to purchase things from the augment faction store.
