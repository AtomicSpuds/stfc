Also rewarded is 3* raw materials, presuming you complete the mining.
The amount awarded depends on reputation.

F Miner      gas
F Excavator  gas ore crystal
K Miner      crystal
K Excavator  crystal gas ore
R Miner      ore
R Excavator  ore gas crystal
```

Consider the Miner 3* material to be `m3*` and the Excavator 3* material
to be `e3*1`, `e3*2`, `e3*3` then you can follow the following table:

```
