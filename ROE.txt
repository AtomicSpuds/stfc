Rules Of Engagement (applicable to server 016)
----------------------------------------------

Fair Game to Attack:
- a miner on a mine with 0 resources
- a miner on a mine with recoverable cargo (see below)
- a warship on a mine is fair game to attack
- if you get bumped 'against roe rules' you can attack with your warship and
  get your miner back on (or have help to do so)
- warship in space

Can't Attack:
- a miner actively mining with 0 recoverable cargo and resources still left
  in the mine
- a miner resetting a node with the same ship
- a NorthStar unless 0 node or full (not mining) (DC only)

Common Courtesy:
- do not warp directly to a node from another system
- do not monopolize resources (one alliance occupying all nodes in a system is
  not permitted)

There are two councils, both with different RoE.  It is unclear how they can
co exist so enjoy being careful!

Some further verbose reasoning:

Recoverable cargo .. if you tap the mine, it shows you the resource, and has
a [scan] and [attack] button.  If you tap the 'scan' button, you get a battle
lineup.  If you tap the [rewards] chest at the bottom, it will show you
'Enemy Cargo'.  If 'Enemy Cargo' is empty, they are not over their protected
limit.  If you want to see your ship's protected limit, you select your
ship, then tap the [manage] button (only available when at your base), then
on the right choose the 'details' tab and under the 'utility' section you
can see your protected cargo limit.

See 'NOTES.txt' on ship color meaning.

Given that mining resources reset once a miner leaves after resources are 0,
miners that start mining then go afk that deplete the mine are 'wasting' the
potential to mine for others.

Given that there is typically a lot of protected cargo, attacking a miner
that has 0 resources left in the mine sends them back to their base with
resources, and frees up the mine to be mined by others.

Given that a warship (and mot a mining ship) mines much more slowly than
a mining ship, if everybody mined with warships, many fewer resources would
be mined and they would tie up the mines.  Therefore, a warship is 'fair game'
to attack on a mine.

Given that you can scan ships on mines to determine if there is cargo you
could recover, and that it only shows more than 0 if they've gone over
their protected cargo limit, they've exceeded their welcome on the mine and
need to be sent home.

Note your 'Inbox' has a record of your last 20 battles, in the event you
want to write down who attacked you or click on his name to send him a
polite message or check if they got resources (over protected cargo) ;-)

Screenshots are somoetimes necessary to prove various attack scenarios.
The battle report shows who, the battle log 1st entry shows who attacked.

The above is my verbage and my interpretation of ROE.  The below is the
actual verbage from DC (Dark Council) that the other two councils (LC and CoG)
are following.  It was presented just before 6/11/2019:

Rules of Engagement

1. Miners actively mining normally can't be attacked unless Opc or on a
   0 node.

2. NORTHSTARS can only be attacked on 0 node or when unable to mine
   (capacity reached).

3. Botany Bays are only protected while mining data. 

4. Any RoE violations will be dealt with immediately. The offending
   player will be KOS for 24hrs. Optionally 5 miners of the offending
   player's alliance maybe be killed instead if approved by leadership.

5/D. If you need the mine take it. (Valid only in lvl 28 and above
     systems on Envoy and Fortunate miners). Retaliation by a player after
     using this clause is not covered by rule 4. Should only be used if no
     other nodes are available and/or a daily mission needs to be completed.

6. RoE may be suspended for Scopely events/wars/player made events/and
   to manage RoE violations as deemed necessary by the alliance/DC/LC
