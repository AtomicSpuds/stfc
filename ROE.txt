Rules Of Engagement
-------------------

Fair Game to Attack:
- a miner on a mine with 0 resources
- a miner on a mine with recoverable cargo (see below)
- a warship on a mine is fair game to attack
- if you get bumped 'against roe rules' you can attack with your warship and
  get your miner back on (or have help to do so)

Can't Attack:
- a miner actively mining with 0 recoverable cargo and resources still left
  in the mine

Some further verbose reasoning:

Recoverable cargo .. if you tap the mine, it shows you the resource, and has
a [scan] and [attack] button.  If you tap the 'scan' button, you get a battle
lineup.  If you tap the [rewards] chest at the bottom, it will show you
'Enemy Cargo'.  If 'Enemy Cargo' is empty, they are not over their protected
limit.  If you want to see your ship's protected limit, you select your
ship, then tap the [manage] button (only available when at your base), then
on the right choose the 'details' tab and under the 'utility' section you
can see your protected cargo limit.

See 'NOTES.txt' on ship color meaning.

Given that mining resources reset once a miner leaves after resources are 0,
miners that start mining then go afk that deplete the mine are 'wasting' the
potential to mine for others.

Given that there is typically a lot of protected cargo, attacking a miner
that has 0 resources left in the mine sends them back to their base with
resources, and frees up the mine to be mined by others.

Given that a warship (and mot a mining ship) mines much more slowly than
a mining ship, if everybody mined with warships, many fewer resources would
be mined and they would tie up the mines.  Therefore, a warship is 'fair game'
to attack on a mine.

Given that you can scan ships on mines to determine if there is cargo you
could recover, and that it only shows more than 0 if they've gone over
their protected cargo limit, they've exceeded their welcome on the mine and
need to be sent home.

Note your 'Inbox' has a record of your last 20 battles, in the event you
want to write down who attacked you or click on his name to send him a
polite message ;-)
