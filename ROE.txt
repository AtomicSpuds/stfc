Rules Of Engagement
-------------------

Fair Game to Attack:
- a miner on a mine with 0 resources
- a miner on a mine with recoverable cargo
- a warship on a mine is fair game to attack
- if you get bumped 'against roe rules' you can attack with your warship and
  get your miner back on (or have help to do so)

Can't Attack:
- a miner actively mining with 0 recoverable cargo and resources still left
  in the mine

Some further verbose reasoning:

Given that mining resources reset once a miner leaves after resources are 0,
miners that start mining then go afk tat depleat the mine are 'wasting' the
potential to mine for others.

Given that there is typically a lot of protected cargo, attacking a miner
that has 0 resources left in the mine sendes them back to their base with
resources, and frees up the mine to be mined by others.

Given that a warship (and mot a mining ship) mines much more slowly than
a mining ship, if everybody mined with warships, many fewer resources would
be mined and they would tie up the mines.  Therefore, a warship is 'fair game'
to attack on a mine.

Given that you can scan ships on mines to determine if there is cargo you
could recover, and that it only shows more than 0 if they've gone over
their protected cargo limit, they've exceeded their welcome on the mine and
need to be sent home.
