Rules Of Engagement (applicable to server 016)
----------------------------------------------

Fair Game to Attack:
- a miner on a mine with 0 resources
- a miner on a mine with recoverable cargo (see below)
- a warship on a mine is fair game to attack
- if you get bumped 'against roe rules' you can attack with your warship and
  get your miner back on (or have help to do so)
- warship in space

Can't Attack:
- a miner actively mining with 0 recoverable cargo and resources still left
  in the mine
- a miner resetting a node with the same ship
- a NorthStar unless 0 node or full (not mining) (DC only)

Common Courtesy:
- do not warp directly to a node from another system
- do not monopolize resources (one alliance occupying all nodes in a system is
  not permitted)

There are two councils, both with different RoE.  It is unclear how they can
co exist so enjoy being careful!

Some further verbose reasoning:

Recoverable cargo .. if you tap the mine, it shows you the resource, and has
a [scan] and [attack] button.  If you tap the 'scan' button, you get a battle
lineup.  If you tap the [rewards] chest at the bottom, it will show you
'Enemy Cargo'.  If 'Enemy Cargo' is empty, they are not over their protected
limit.  If you want to see your ship's protected limit, you select your
ship, then tap the [manage] button (only available when at your base), then
on the right choose the 'details' tab and under the 'utility' section you
can see your protected cargo limit.

See 'NOTES.txt' on ship color meaning.

Given that mining resources reset once a miner leaves after resources are 0,
miners that start mining then go afk that deplete the mine are 'wasting' the
potential to mine for others.

Given that there is typically a lot of protected cargo, attacking a miner
that has 0 resources left in the mine sends them back to their base with
resources, and frees up the mine to be mined by others.

Given that a warship (and mot a mining ship) mines much more slowly than
a mining ship, if everybody mined with warships, many fewer resources would
be mined and they would tie up the mines.  Therefore, a warship is 'fair game'
to attack on a mine.

Given that you can scan ships on mines to determine if there is cargo you
could recover, and that it only shows more than 0 if they've gone over
their protected cargo limit, they've exceeded their welcome on the mine and
need to be sent home.

Note your 'Inbox' has a record of your last 20 battles, in the event you
want to write down who attacked you or click on his name to send him a
polite message or check if they got resources (over protected cargo) ;-)

Screenshots are somoetimes necessary to prove various attack scenarios.
The battle report shows who, the battle log 1st entry shows who attacked.

The above is my verbage and my interpretation of ROE.  The below is the
actual approved verbage approved by the Leadership Council of server 016
on April 26, 2019:

Mining Rules of Engagement for Galaxy:

1. Surveyor Class "Mining Ships" can be engaged for combat while mining under the following circumstances:
   a. Miner is over the protected cargo capacity.
   b. Miner is on a zero node. A message must be sent to player indicating why they were removed from mine.

2. Surveyor Class "Mining Ships" are not free to target under the following conditions.
   a. Actively Mining and not over the protected cargo capacity.
   b. Resetting a node with the SAME MINER.  This is evident and common courtesy.

3. Mining Etiquette
   a. Do not warp directly to a node from another system
   b. No monopolization of resources. An Alliance(s) shall not be allowed to occupy all the nodes of any system.

War Ships are open to attack at any time.  This includes a battleship, explorer, and interceptor floating in space or engaged in the act of mining.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Dark Council (DC) has the following as their RoE:

1. Miners can't be attacked unless Opc or on a 0 node--message intention
   or explanation, if feasible
2. NORTHSTARS can only be attacked on 0 node or when unable to mine (capacity
   reached)
3. Any RoE violations will be dealt with immediately. 10 miners of the
   offending alliance will be hit for each 1 RoE violation. 
4. RoE may be suspended for scopely events/wars/player made events/and to
   manage RoE violations as deemed necessary by the Dark Council.
