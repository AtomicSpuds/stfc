Franklin - swarm killer!

If you like boring math, see the bottom.

If you like hand waiving here we are!

The Franklin dailies are nice to get bio matter, not frequency modulators.

The Franklin does dailies well once it's been leveled up with frequency
modulators.

Therefore, one ought to ignore dailies and focus of FM on the highest return
from 5 trips with the franklin to swarm.

We'll give Spuds Franklin for example. It can hit 2 lvl26 or 20 lvl24.
That translates into 2x108=216 or 20x63=1260.  So The sweet spot for now
is lvl24.  5 trips means 6300 FM per day if I don't involve other ships
and I dont do more than 5 trips.

The higher you get the Franklin, the higher level swarm is the sweet spot,
and the more FM you can get, the more you can level it up, the more FM you
can get ...


Now for some math:

Lets take a lvl20 daily..

```
  Amount: 50  20   8
   Level: 15  20  22
FM Count: 50 460 312 = 822 FM/day
```

Lets take 15+20+22 hits and translate that to lvl20:

```
 57 hits x 23 FM/hit = 1311 FM/day
```

Lets hit 200 lvl24:

```
 200 hits = 63 FM/hit = 12600 FM/day
```
