To me personally officers is somewhat a black art still.

Nevertheless, I have figured out a few things:

 - all officers have a 'captain' maneauver which activates if they are captain
 - all officers have an 'officer ability' which activates if they are on the
   bridge
 - all officers have attack/defense/health points which contribute to the
   ships strength if they are on the ship
 - captains 'work well' and 'increse effectiveness of abilities' if you put
   bridge offers that 'work well' with the captain, a lightning bolt indicates
   this once a captain has been chosen
 - station abilities are active only if the officer is on a ship docked at
   the station
