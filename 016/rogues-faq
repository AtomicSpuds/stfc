2. Rogue Watch has been created to be fast and loose (anybody can report players via #rogue-player-reporting or coords via #rogue-player-coords) with a tiny bit of admin sprinkles (SFHC staff and trusted individuals can maintain #rogue-player-list ).  As such, anyone willing to be a watcher (searching, reporting coords, posting updated profiles, new player bits) or a hunter (using coords to attack rogue players) is welcomed to be invited.  They will need to contact @SpudsMcKinsey, @weezerten, or @lillykins to get 'Rogue Watch' role assigned.

3. Please chat in #open-channel and post reports and supporting bits in #rogue-player-reporting and coords in #rogue-player-coords.  Examples exist.  For a player to be be added to the rogue list, a profile and supporting reasoning should be presented.

4. Stats tracking is like a fingerprint, that is why the leaderboard has that info, incase a player changes their name/alliance one can match up with last seen stats.

5. This is a politics free zone.  RoE breakers typically hit miners not opc and clear entire systems breaking any past or future version of RoE.  Any alliance or council that cares about RoE will want to hunt and haunt these individuals.  To keep the maximum damage with a minimum of delay in communication Rogue Watch was created as a place for any player wanting to help inflict damage to the rogues.  Even if a players ship cannot do damage, the player can be a watcher and help those who can do damage know where the targets are.  Thank you for crossing alliance and council lines to help make the server a more hostile environment to rogue players.

6. Feedback is welcomed, if any aspect of Rogue Watch could use improvement, please feel free to use #open-channel to .. open a channel of communication! ï¿¼
