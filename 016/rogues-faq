F.A.Q.

1. Rogue Player (rogue) - a player who embodies one or more of the following qualities:
  - does not play by any form of standard
  - is worthy of galaxy wide KOS
  - who has a very depraved, negative, or deeply insulting conversation in GC
  - related reasoning

 .. bottom line: if you want to KOS them and we want to KOS them, lets coordinate our efforts, eh?

2. Rogue Watch was created as a place for any player wanting to help inflict damage on rogue players. Watching or targeting can both help. This needs to be fast and loose to be effective.  Anybody can report players via #rogue-watch-reporting or coords via #rogue-watch-coords.  List updates are by @SFHC Officers and other trusted individuals.

3. No politics! Thank you for crossing alliance and council lines to help make our server a more hostile environment to rogue players.

4. Please chat in #rogue-watch-chat and post reports and supporting bits in #rogue-watch-reporting and coords in #rogue-watch-coords.  Examples exist.  For a player to be be added to the rogue list, a profile and supporting reasoning should be presented.

5. Stats tracking is like a fingerprint, that is why the leaderboard on #rogue-watch-list has that info, incase a player changes their name/alliance one can match up with last seen stats.

6. Feedback is welcomed, if any aspect of Rogue Watch could use improvement, please feel free to use #rogue-watch-chat

7. https://discord.gg/x5UJHQa - invite people you know who want to watch for or target rogue players.  Once they join, have them contact @SFHC Officers to get the 'Rogue Watch' role assigned.
