Zhang 19 - 20 Boslic Slave Trader

Hostile Population Algorithm Behavior (my observations only!)
- fixed # of hostiles in any given system
- kill one, it gets replaced
- when spawning, weighted random generator, guessing roughly:
   50% system level -1
   30% system level
   20% system level +1
- when more than one type, each level is then split into a % based on type,
   use your observations to see, some systems have traders, my guess is:
     80% patrol
     20% trader
   but I bet it is system based and not a general rule
- corrilary is you can 'extinct' a given level or type of hostile because
  random will eventually randomly choose what you are not hunting
- fixing 'extinct' hostile types/levels requires you ore someone else
  to hit hostiles that are in the system until your preferred type randomly
  gets chosen at spawn time
