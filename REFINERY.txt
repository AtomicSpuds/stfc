Some people are wondering what refinery output corresponds to batchsize and
perhaps even refinery level.

So I'm logging my refinery utilizations in the event someone can see a pattern.

                  RL Time  G2C CRC URC G2G CRG G2O   CRO

G2O = Grade 2 Ore
G2C = Grade 2 Crystal
G2G = Grade 2 Gas

CRO = Common Refined Ore
CRC = Common Refined Crystal
CRG = Common Refined Gas

URC = Uncommon Refined Crystal
