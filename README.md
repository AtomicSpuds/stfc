Subject: stfc - notes and bits of info on Star Trek Fleet Command
From: Atomic Spuds <AtomicSpudsGame@gmail.com>
To: anyone reading this

I've noted a few individuals asking for info.  Rather than repeat it
every time someone asks, I collect it here for my own use and others.

I welcome others to contribute, or send corrections.  I am only human!

While 100% of the data in these files is collected and entered by me, a
small bit of (fleshed out northstar missions) was retyped from HiveMind.
The rest is based on my own data entry from my own mobile devices.  I
would be remiss to not point out this awesome resource
that is a bot on a discord server you can query for info.  It is more
info complete than my personal crib notes.  I still update my own notes
based on what I see since that is how I understand info.  I also have a
few bits they have not yet implemented, such as range of rss hostiles
give in a given system.  In the past there was a tool called HiveMind
but for reasons I won't get into here, that went away.  These days spot
checking can occur via the STFC Database (Ripper is awesome!).  If you
wish to checkout the STFC Database head to:

Enjoy!

Thanks,
