In general the computer 'knows whats best' in terms of the next thing to build.

However, there are times, like when you don't have resources to build the next thing,
that perhaps building another cheaper thing might keep building vs delay everything to
build the computer recommended next thing.

Major milestones:

Level 10 - players can attack you and vica versa
Level 15 - your station can get attacked
Level 16 - vaults are an option (to keep TRI/DIL/PAR from being raided to 0)
Level 17 - drydock c
Level 18 - DIL generator C
Level 20 - Refinery can refine 3* materials
