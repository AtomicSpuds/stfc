Scopely Knows about these and has yet to fix them ...

**Research**
1. All faction ship structure researches not working as intended
2. The  Pure Gas, Pure Crystal, and Pure Ore research and additionally the faction research to reduce ore, crystal, and gas costs functions "server side". Unfortunately, for everyone, the client will still require that you have the UC/Rare amounts before research. This is basically `cash back` but rather `raw material back` so you have to acquire more than you need.

**Officers**
1. Vemet
 a. don't use as captain when attacking a base, you will get stuck! (on a good day 2h fix after ticket submitted)
 b. don't use as captain when mining and turtle attack coming, you will be mining but display not showing right after, you can move to another node but if someone lands on the node you were killed on they will actually attack and kill you
 c. known to not activate if you don't get to the 2nd round of battle, envoy vs 1.5m trained fighter for exxample
 .. safe to warp into system, get killed in space, then proceed to mine after resurection
2. Helvia/Domitia
warp speed modifying abilities can sometimes (but not always!) confuse turtles, they can spawn en route and you can be killed before you arrive

**Gameplay**
1. infinity battle
 move another ship or step off base or mine to end
2. base stuck
 if you can't port, someone must damage your base, then once you repair it, whatever prevented you porting will be magically fixed
3. Attack a base, get 0 rss.  BugBug! Base is not empty, no damage either direction registered, nor does it show in the battle log, but you see the battle animation.  Try again with a different ship or move on to another base.
4. Building/Research/Ship Build counters stuck
   you can get notifications of 'help' but counters don't move at times. restart app shows correct value (retrieves counter from server)
5. Stuck notification box
   get to chat by tapping on the lower left alliance button then tap on chat
   rotate device
6. Shield was activated, but didn't actually update server, caused by
   activating shield + rapidly exit/force stop the app
   to be _sure_ exit app and restart (loads state from server)

**Armadas**
1. Won't let me join but I am in system.
   Some state is bogus that gets reset when you restart your client app.
2. Won't let me join but I can land next to the armada in pleanty of time!
   Do that. Once you land in system join. Likely you put Helvia on the bridge, and Armadas haven't learned to account for her warp speed increase yet.
3. Won't let me join but I ported in to get there in time.
   Restart client app.
4. I participated but I did not have a glowey circle.
   Apparently participation flags do not always create a glowey circle. I have join'ed normally, warped to an Aramda circle, and only when I step out and step back in does it start glowing.
5. My officers don't activate but another players did!
   The battle log is generated words from the actual computer battle records.  Multiples of any officer will only show one activation because the word generator only shows the 1st one.  Rest assured your officer did their ability.  The battle log word generator needs work.
